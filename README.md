Questions:

• In your point of view, what was complicated in the TP#2? What where your pain points?
What could you do when expanding this TP to avoid these further?

The tp2 was complicated with the establishment of the connexion with the API but after that, it was not really difficult just by understand how the Json on the API work

• What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s
clean code, clean architecture?

The SOLID principles are 5 concepts that make design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. The "KISS Rule" is a 
concept that have as slogan : "Keep It Simple Stupid". The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Finally, 
the "boy scout rule" is a rule that stipule to always leave the code better than you found it. All these rules are made to keep a clean code and a clean architecture.
A clean code can be read and improved by a developer other than the person who wrote it. With understandability comes readability, ease of change, extensibility and maintainability.

• How would you expand this code? What can you add to the software you build to make it
more useful, reliable, relevant to the user? Find 5 ways to improve your previous TP, even if
that’s not doable.

I can improve my previous TP by making more class, making my code more clean, optimize my code.
